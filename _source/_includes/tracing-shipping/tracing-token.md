You must have admin permissions for the Logz.io account to view the **Manage tokens** page. If you're not an admin user for the account, consult with an account admin to get the Distributed Tracing token information. 

   From your main account, go to the <a href="https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/settings/manage-tokens/data-shipping" target ="_blank"> **Manage tokens > Data shipping** page</a> of your Operations workspace, and select the **Tracing** tab. <br> It can be reached by selecting **<i class="li li-gear"></i> > Settings > Manage tokens**, and clicking the **Tracing** option in the **Data shipping tokens** tab. 

   Find the Distributed Tracing account you want to ship to in the table, and copy the token.
